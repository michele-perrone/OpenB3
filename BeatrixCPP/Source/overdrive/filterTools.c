/* ************************************************************************
 * Windowing functions. These functions return a scale factor between 0-1.
 * It is applied to an array of signals so that they may be scaled
 * according to their position in the array.
 *
 * @param i  Value w's position in array (m/2 is middle element)
 * @param m  Total number of elements.
 *
 * For example, if the kernel has three elements, w[0], w[1] and w[2], then
 * the calls to the Hamming window function would be:
 *
 * w[0] = wdw_Hamming (w[0], 0, 3);
 *
 * The middle element is typically not called because the sinc function
 * commonly used for the left and right halfs collapse there into a
 * division by zero.
 *
 * w[2] = wdw_Hamming (w[2], 2, 3);
 *
 * The argument to cos() will typically go from 0-2pi, ie a full circle.
 * So as i (element index) is incremented from 0 to m-1, the Hanning window
 * expression   0.5 - (0.5 * cos(f(i)))  will take the values
 *
 *             [0, ..., 0.5, ..., 1.0, ..., 0.5, ..., 0]
 *              0pi     0.5pi     1pi       1.5pi    2pi
 *
 * which is the positive half of a sinusoid. The shape of the resulting
 * curve is modified by altering the coefficients slightly (Hamming) or
 * by introducing a touch of the second harmonic (Blackman).
